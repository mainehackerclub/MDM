Maine Discovery Museum Hacking
=================================

Our hackers are doing a lot of good work at the Maine Discovery Museum in Bangor, Maine.  This is the code for the various exhibits that we've repaired or enhanced.

Tasks that must be accomplished:

  1. Inventory current exhibits and status
  2. Document proposed solutions/replacements for various exhibits
  3. Estimate time to complete solutions
