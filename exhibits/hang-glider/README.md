Hang Glider Simulator
==========================

__Current Status:__ :cloud:

Overview
---------

Allows guests to lie in a real hang glider harness attached to the ceiling. When looking down, the guest's vision is taken up by a large white board with a video projected on it of others hang gliding.

Future
--------

There is already an IR sensor mounted to the harness. The original implementors plan was to manipulate the project's orientation based on input from the IR sensor. Thus, the camera could "swing" the view in keeping with the visitor, simulating the motion of a hang-glider.

The current status of the IR sensor and any servos attached to the camera should be investigated and a list of necessary repairs compiled to make this exhibit function as designed should be completed.
