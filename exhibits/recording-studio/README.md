Overview
----------

With four microphones in a simulated recording box environment, guests are invited to perform karoke-style while others remain out side the box and control a single camera that can pan and zoom in. Optionally, guests may record their video on a DVD.

Future
-------

The exhibit is in serious need of an over-haul. The hardware controlling the sound is currently way over-complicated for the task, and the video equipment (TVs, camera, servos) are aging quite a bit as well. 

Besides making it easier to operate for volunteers at the museum, an upgrade could also involve recording guest videos directly to an inexpensive portable harddrive and the videos auto-encoded and upload to a private server.

Before starting a song, users could opt to include an email address, and upon completion of the video an link could be sent to the private video hosted over the internet (using something like S3 for storage).

The front desk could also have access to the videos and be able to "on-demand" burn DVDs for visitors upon leaving the museum. Samples of current videos could also be played via a CCTV at the exit to entice guests to purchase a DVD.
