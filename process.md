Process for Upgrading Exhibits
===============================

The Museum is an instiution with responsibilites to their audience,
their board, and a myriad of governmental bodies. This is not a playground,
but a curated space with the goal of illustrating, educating and 
engaging it's target audience.

With this in mind, they cannot allow us to tinker willy-nilly with the
exhibts, even if some are not working consistently or need major repairs.
To that extent, this document outlines a proposed process for managing 
exhibit upgrade proposals. Hopefully this makes the process easier for
hackers and the Museum administration to do best while keeping to their
responsiblities.

  1. Identify reason for upgrade
  2. Document overview of proposed upgrade
  3. Include resource need and their proposed sources ( or lack of sources)
  4. Outline simple timeline for how long the upgrade will take, be realistic as a volunteer
  5. Provide proof of concept, maybe allowing to run simultaneously with current exhibit but out of the way
  6. Ensure that new proposal will always be easier to maintain than the one it's replacing
